# Meshy App - 3D Model Generation and Viewer

**Meshy App** is a web application developed as part of an internship project for Lid Vizion. It allows users to generate 3D models from text prompts or image URLs, and also provides a 3D model viewer to upload and interact with .glb and .gltf files. This project is built using React, Three.js, and integrates APIs to convert text and images into 3D models.

## Features

- **Generate 3D Models from Text**: Users can input a text description to create a 3D model.
- **Convert Images to 3D Models**: Users can submit an image URL, and the app will convert the image to a 3D model.
- **3D Model Viewer**: Allows users to upload and interact with 3D models (in .glb or .gltf format) through zoom, rotation, and panning.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Smooth Animations**: Features subtle animations for a modern and visually appealing interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js
- **APIs**: Backend APIs to process text and images into 3D models
- **Version Control**: Git

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later) and npm should be installed on your machine.

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/playdigidash/openhub.git)
   cd meshy-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Home Page**: Provides an overview and introduction to the app.
2. **Meshy Text to 3D**: Enter a description in the input field and click "Generate 3D Model" to create a model based on your description.
3. **Meshy Image to 3D**: Enter an image URL and click "Convert to 3D" to generate a model from the image. A progress bar will indicate the generation status.
4. **3D Model Viewer**: Use the "Choose File" button to upload a .glb or .gltf file, and interact with the model using orbit controls (rotate, zoom, pan).

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error feedback, especially for API failures.
- **Support for Additional 3D Formats**: Extend model viewer to support more file types such as FBX or OBJ.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Additional animations, tooltips, and an onboarding tutorial for first-time users.
- **Save and Share Models**: Allow users to save generated models or share them via a link.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize rendering for smoother interactions, especially for complex models.
